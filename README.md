### A few things about me

⚡️ With a passion for constructing user-friendly designs, my goal is to provide the best user experience possible.

🔭 Currently, I'm exploring cross-platform languages like Flutter & React Native and serverless technologies.

👫🏽 My interests lie in collaborating on projects that tackle real-world issues or innovative solutions, such as constructing a solution that doesn't exist yet or hasn't been widely accepted in the target market.

👀 Looking for employment opportunities too
