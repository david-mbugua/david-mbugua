## Hey there, I am David. 👋
I am a software engineer based in Nairobi,Kenya. 
I mostly work with Javascript frameworks and libraries(ReactJS & NodeJS) to build solutions and improve existing systems.

⚡️ I have a passion for building intuitive designs to give users the best experience.

🔭 I am currently exploring cross platform languages such as Flutter & React Native, and serveless technologies.

👫🏽 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are centered around solving real world problems or innovative solutions like
building a solution that does not exist or is not yet widely adopted in the target market.

📫 How to reach me: you can reach me via LinkedIn or via email (davidnginyo11@gmail.com).
